  Apex Development
  
Custom Apex logic was implemented to support business rules around vehicle ordering, stock validation, and scheduled updates. The following classes and triggers were created:

ðŸ“Œ VehicleOrderTriggerHandler.cls
A trigger handler class that modularizes logic for Vehicle_Order__c triggers.
Prevents order creation if the selected vehicle is out of stock.
Updates vehicle stock by reducing quantity when an order is confirmed.

ðŸ“Œ VehicleOrderTrigger.trigger
Calls the VehicleOrderTriggerHandler class on insert and update.
Executes logic in both before and after contexts.

ðŸ“Œ VehicleOrderBatch.cls
Batch Apex job that scans for orders with status 'Pending'.
If stock becomes available, it sets the order status to 'Confirmed' and reduces vehicle stock accordingly.

ðŸ“Œ VehicleOrderBatchScheduler.cls
Scheduled Apex class that invokes VehicleOrderBatch daily.
Ensures pending orders are regularly checked and updated based on stock.

ðŸ”„ Flows

### ðŸ“Œ AutoAssignDealer (Flow)
- Triggered on `Vehicle_Order__c` create/update
- Gets nearest `Vehicle_Dealer__c` based on customer location
- Assigns it to the order
  
### ðŸ“Œ TestDriveReminder (Scheduled Flow)
- Scheduled 1 day before `Test_Drive_Date__c`
- Fetches customer email
- Sends a reminder email

Debug / Manual Test Execution
To test the batch job from Developer Console:

### Execute this in Anonymous Window:
```apex
VehicleOrderBatch job = new VehicleOrderBatch();
Database.executeBatch(job, 50);
